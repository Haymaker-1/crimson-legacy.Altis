<p>
A couple of months ago, CSAT launched an offensive to gain control of the North-Western part of Altis. During the Battle for Kavala, many civilians were driven from their homes by the oppressor, and as a result, many have joined the Resistance.

Since then, NATO has been covertly supporting the Resistance by deploying special forces teams to the region. The special forces are training the Resistance in guerrilla warfare methods, while advising them in strategic matters. An immediate problem that the rebels are facing is that they have almost run out of fuel. Becuase this greatly affects their fighting capabilities, it is paramount that the deep-water harbor of Kavala is liberated from any and all enemy forces, and that supply lines are re-established.
